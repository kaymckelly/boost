    Welcome to Boost! This is our mascot, a happy piece of toast. (Yeah, we know: it's cute.)

    Boost helps you do three things:
    <ul class="homeText">
      <li>Boost your own self-esteem</li>
      <li>Encourage you to boost others' self-esteem</li>
      <li>Teach a variety of self-care techniques</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="explainText">
    You're not required to log in; the self-care features are publicly available. But the core functionality - boosting your and others' self-esteem - requires you to be logged in. We use your Instagram account to verify your identity, so trolls can be held responsible should there be any.
